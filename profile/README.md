### Welcome!
RyzOS Project is a custom Android ROM based on **LineageOS** & **Evolution X** .

We started RyzOS not because we wanted to compete with other systems. We got tired. Tired of systems that were too complex, too heavy, too noisy.

### Codename: Anxiety
RyzOS started out as a place of restlessness. We wanted a system that was light, quiet, and gave the user spaceâ€”not one that weighed them down.
